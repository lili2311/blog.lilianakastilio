The gorgeous city of Havana has plenty to offer, it is the cultural center of the country with an abundance of palaces, museums, parks, public squares and even fortresses. Great weather, american cars and gorgeous building, what's not to love?! We stayed in Havana for only 5 days, which I admit was a little short for the amount of things to see and do but we managed to sqeeze in plenty. Our Casa Particular was located on a busy main road of San Lazaro near the univercity and this turned out the perfect place for us as we wanted to eat and live like locals as much as possible. The location was very central and all the major sites were a short walk away. So from my amazing stay there recently these are the few things I would recommend as a must do while in Havana:

####1. Walk along the Malecon

This 8km stretch along the sea shore is an amazing walk and prvides great views of the city and the countless monuments and squares that are dotted about. On stormy days the waves reach all the way onto the main road, so be prepared to get a little wet.

####2. Old Havana

This is the ancient and original city of Havana founded by the Spanish in 1519. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage list and it is easy to see why. Countless beautiful buildings some restorted and some completely fallen apart, the little winding streets are an adventure in itself to explore. This is the most touristy part of Havana but it is also the most beautiful. There is a large number of bars and cafes around here as well as hotels.

####3. Visit the 18th century cemetery Necropolis Cristobal Colon

Built in 1876 this cemetery is also an open air museum, with over 1 million tombs. It is more of a dead city with many roads and gorgeous buildings and very extravagant tombs.

*23 m high monument to the firefighters who lost their lives in the great fire of May 17, 1890.

####4. Visit the district of Vedado

This is the urban and business district of the city, this is an area bursting with life, monuments and cafes. The area is a mixture of old mansions and tall rise buildings. 

####5. Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro (Morro Castle)

####6. Capitolio

####7. Eat pizza

####8. Visit the African Culture Center (check actual name TO DO)
