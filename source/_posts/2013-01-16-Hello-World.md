This blog is intended as a place to document my progress as I attempt to learn web development. From HTML to python and everything in between, the goal is to try everything and try to do it using different tools and technologies to gain a better understanding of web development. I will try to explain everything I have learned and used as I go along in as much detail as possible in the hope that it will help to cement the knowledge in my brain. 
The list of the work so far can be found [here](http://www.lilianakastilio.co.uk).

I am also a keen traveller, so time to time I will write about my adventures around the world and anythng related.
