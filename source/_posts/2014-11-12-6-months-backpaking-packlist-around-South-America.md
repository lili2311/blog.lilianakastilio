title: Backpacking 6 Months Packlist for Girls
tags: [travel]
---

Trying to fit everything you may need for 6 months into a 65L bag is not easy, especially as a girl. I had to consider hot climates, farming in the jungle, camping on the beach as well as the colder mountain areas of Peru and some parts of Bolivia. It took me 3 or 4 packing attempts to see what fits and what can be discarded. In the end this is what I ended up with in my bag:

####Important documents and info

1. Backpackers Insurance
2. Tourist Card/Visas
3. Important info on paper/laptop/phone. I had all the info saved on all 3, carrying paper around is annoying, but I could access any info I needed on my phone with printed out version used as a backup in case I am unable to charge my phone/laptop. 
	1. Your country's embassy addresses and numbers in each country you are visiting
	2. Lost/Stolen card bank numbers
	3. Your insurance numbers and policy number
	4. Printed out insurance policy confirmation with countries covered and names clearly visible (certain countries require proof of insurance)
	4. Relatives and friends, also emergency contacts
	5. Accomodation addresses and numbers
	6. List of credit card numbers and bank account numbers
	7. Passport number
	8. Passport photocopies
	9. Flight details
4. Yellow fever certificate (if required)
5. Vaccines booklet

####Required vaccines (covering Cuba, Mexico, Belize, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil and Chile)

We had to start 
all vaccinations at least 6 weeks before the trip as some of them require multiple shots at certain intervals (ie 7, 14 days). Most of these were free from a GP but the rest were from a Travel Clinic.

1. Hep A
2. Hap B
3. Typhoid
4. Yellow Fever
5. Rabies
6. Tetanus
7. Diphtheria
8. Polio
9. Malaria - had to bring antimalarians with us, we bought these at a travel clinic for the number of days that we may be present in a malaria zone)
10. Cholera - for the affected areas the advice was to use water purifying tables, wash hands, wash and peel all fruit and vegetables before consuming, avoid ice creams and ice or any drinks with questionable water. We bougt water purifying bottles to make things easier.

####Camping/Backpacking gear:

For certains parts of our trip it will be possible for us to camp, so far we have arranged to camp on a beach in Mexico and it is considerably cheaper than other accomodation. Certain farms however may be unfinished an not have any helper accomodation, so it was advisable to have our own tent just in case. Without all this gear the bag would have been considerably smaller and lighter, but this is what we have in terms of gear:

1. Mosquito Net
2. Season 1 Sleeping Bag (I used [Vango Planet 50](http://www.gapyeartravelstore.com/vango-1-2-season-planet-50-sleeping-bag.html))	 
3. Tent
4. Insect repellent with no DEET (to be used in cities and places with less insects as well as organic farms)
5. Insect repellent with DEET (jungle and malaria high risk areas)
6. Travel detergent/general cleaner (I used [DR Bronner](http://www.drbronner.co.uk/sal-suds-liquid-cleaner-1/))
7. Backpack (I used [Osprey Ariel 65L]())
8. Travel Towel (quick drying)
9. Inflatable Pillow

11. Rain cover for the backpack
12. Small face/hands towel

14. Head torch
15. Swiss army knife (Victorinox)

17. Plastic bags for wet things and rubbish
18. Garnening gloves (for farming)
19. Sleeping mask

####Clothes:

Packing for a range of temperatures between 10C and 35C is a challenge, especially that while we are away it is rain season in most of the countries we are visiting.

	1. Tank top
	1. Evening/go out top
	1. Silk top x 3 (keeps you comfotanble in any weather and dries quickly)
	1. Farming trousers (I used running leggings to keep dry and cool) - ideally long to protect from the sun and the weeds scrathing your legs
	1. Quick dry top (any top that wicks away moisture from the body)
