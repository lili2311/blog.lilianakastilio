Our journey to the remote organic farm in the midle of a Belizian Rainforest had a few stages:

1. Cancun to Belize City by bus
2. Belize City to Punta Gorda by bus
3. Punta Gorda to San Pedro Columbia Village by bus
4. San Pedro Columbia Village to the farm by dory (similar to a canoe)

In this post I will explain how we managed to travel from Belize City to Punta Gorda by bus. Punta Gorda is simply called PG by locals, and Belize City is shoretend to Belize (lots of confusion can be avoided knowing this). Belize has many "bus lines" that cover different routes, the one that we used to get to Punta Gorda is the James Bus line. Most of the buses look like old American school buses and some roads have been modernised, but lots are still just dirt roads.
Here is some advice that I can give after making this journey:

####1. Take the James Bus line from the Belize City bus station

It may not be obvious at all how to get the bus or how to tell them apart, but the bus terminal staff are friendly and helpful. Some of the buses have their name painted on the side of the bus. Everyone simply gets on the bus and pays afetr the bus has started moving. SImply get on as quickly as you can to get a seat, you may have to share with strangers though if teh bus is too full. We shared our 2 person seat with a lovely old lady for about 2 hours!

####2. The loo situation

There are no toilets on any on the buses! Whether your journey is 30minutes of 8 hours doesn't seem to make a difference. At every stop you can get off the bus and use the bus station toilets, but beware that you may lose your seat! 

####3. Ticket cost

The bus ticket cost us 24 Belizian Dollars each (one way). You can also pay in Dollars everywhere in Belize. The exchange rate is fixed of 2 Belizian Dollars to 1 US Dollar.

####4. Food during your journey

If you get hungry on your 8hr trip, do not despair! At every bus stop the local get on the bus and sell some sort of snack, drink or even a full meal. The choices ranged from pizza, sandwiches, flavoured ices, to barbequed meats with rice. Everything is extremely cheap.

####5. Large bags and luggage

If like me you wil have a huge 65L backpack, please note that there is no space for it on the bus! You can try to do some magic and make it fit into the overhead compartments but otherwise that bag is riding on your lap for the entire 8 hrs! There is no other way unfortunately. Some buses have a little room at the back where all the luggage is simply piled up. But you need to keep an eye on your bag as at every stop people simply take a bag and get off through the back door.

####6. One big happy bus family

As a tourist you will most likely stand out like a sore thumb on this bus, and we sure did! Everyone seemed to be talking to everyone else and we did not escape that fate. Some of the old ladies on the bus chatted with us and asked us questions like where we are going and who we are visiting. To my amazement they knew exactly where the farm was and even better they knew the farm owner himself! Turns out Belize is a small country where lots of people know everyone else, even if they are 8 hrs apart! During my stay in Belize I have actually come across those ladies again and they remembered me. It is amazing how friendly everyone was and how familiar with each other.

####7. Bus Timetable

The bus timetable can be founf on the [James Bus Line Website](http://www.jamesbusline.com/). But make sure to arive early and re-check teh times at he station as they often change without notice!
