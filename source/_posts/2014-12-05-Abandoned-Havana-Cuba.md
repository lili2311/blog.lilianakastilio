There is a huge amount of abandoned buildings in Havana, everywhere you look you can find remains of something that used to be impressive and gorgeous. I think they are still beautiful in their own haunting way. This is a side of Havana that is easy to miss if you stick to touristy places and take a taxi everywhere. 

We found this one while walking through the little residential streets in Old Havana. This is the most looked after part of the city but the residentials streets have not seen any TLC for a some time.

This one is a huge construction site at the beginning of the El Prado, but looks like any work has been abandoned long ago.

Not far is this ovegrown house just before one of the squares in Old Havana.

We found this gorgeous mansion while exploring the Bodega area of Havana. It looks liek it has been a school at some point.

And my favourite of them all is the glorious huge tree growing out of the building near the Hemingway's Daiquiry place in Old Havana.
